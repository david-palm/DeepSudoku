#### DeepSudoku is an Android application that allows the user to solve a Sudoku by taking a picture of it with their smartphone camera. It is based on a group project for the course _image processing_ at the _University of Applied Sciences Cologne_. The group project was written in _Python_ as a _Jupyter Notebook_ using the _Google Colab_ platform. I rewrote the project to object-oriented _C++_-code and optimized so that it runs as a stand-alone _Android_ app.
